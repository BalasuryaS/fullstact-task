# fullstact-task
I developed a registration form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with PHP handling the backend operations and MySQL serving as the database. The form captures user details such as username, email, password, and confirm password. Client-side validation ensures that the password adheres to complexity requirements, including at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character, and that the password and confirm password fields match. Additionally, the email format is validated to ensure it's in a valid format. The frontend also features functionality to toggle password visibility, enhancing user experience. On the backend, upon form submission, PHP scripts verify if the email address is already registered in the "users" database table. If the email is already in use, a message notifies the user accordingly. Otherwise, the user's information is securely stored in the "registration" table. Server-side password complexity validation adds an extra layer of security. This comprehensive approach ensures a seamless user registration process while maintaining data integrity and security.
